    "### Query with accumulators\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let’s write a more advanced query. This time, we are going to learn to use the powerful built-in accumulators, which serve as the runtime attributes (properties) attachable to each vertex visited during our traversal on the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Runtime\" means they exist only while the query is running; they are called accumulators because they are specially designed to gather (accumulate) data during the implicitly parallel processing of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we need to write a query to find all the persons which are exactly 2 hops away from the parameterized input Person. Just for fun, let’s also compute the average age of those 2-hop neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method\n",
    "\n",
    "To get all Person vertices that are two hops away from the starting vertex, we can use the following logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "From the starting vertex, visit vertices that are one stop away from the starting vertex, and mark every vertex we visit as visited, including the starting vertex. This gives us the neighbors that are 1 hop away from the starting vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have the 1-hop neighbors, we can find vertices that are 1-hop away from those neighbors, excluding all vertices that we have already visited in the previous step. This gives us all vertices that are exactly two hops away from the original vertex. As we visit the 2-hop neighbors, we can also calculate their average age.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Query\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a SELECT statement to perform the first hop from the starting vertex. In order to keep track of vertices that have been visited, we declare a vertex-attached accumulator of the type OrAccum, also called a boolean accumulator. In addition, we also need to declare an AvgAccum to calculate the average age of the final vertex set.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a vertex-attached accumulator, prefix an identifier name with a single @ symbol. After you declare the accumulator, they are attached to vertices in the query, and you can access its value in an ACCUM or POST-ACCUM clause of the SELECT statement by using the dot. operator following a vertex alias as if they are an attribute of the vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the first hop, we use another SELECT statement to perform a second hop, and filter out all vertices that we have visited previously. This gives us the neighbors that are exactly two hops away, and we can use the AvgAccum to calculate the average age of the 2-hop neighbors."
